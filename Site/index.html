        <p>I am a writer and programmer living in Canada. I have worked at start-ups, scale-ups, multi-national conglomerates, and Big Tech. I've worked on medtech, AI, and networking, with a special focus on embedding programming. I've also <a href="/stories.html">published</a> several stories and have a brown belt in Judo.</p>
<p>I like helping people. I especially like helping people in the following areas of interest: AI, writing, and programming. I was given some crucial pieces of advice early on in my career that set me up for the sucess which I now enjoy. I would like nothing more than to help others in the same way that I was helped.</p>
<p>Therefore, my standing invitation: <strong>if you want to talk about software, AI, or writing, I want to talk  to you.</strong></p>
<p>If you are reading this, especially if you are a <a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421">Guess Culture</a> person like me, you are hereby invited to email me at <code>contact@</code> this domain. The absolute worst that will happen is that I am busy and will not respond, and even that is very unlikely. People take me up on this offer a couple of times a month and I almost always respond.</p>
